    <h1>🎉 How I Planned My Father's Birthday Party 🎉</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🎯 The Idea</h2>
        <p>It all started with one simple thought — making dad smile like never before. I wanted this birthday to be memorable, emotional, and filled with warmth. So, I decided to go all out and plan a surprise party!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>📅 Planning & Budgeting</h2>
        <p>I began a month in advance. Set a small budget, and listed down all essentials — cake, decorations, food, guests, and gifts. I made an Excel sheet to manage every rupee and task.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🏠 Venue & Decor</h2>
        <p>We transformed our living room with fairy lights, photo frames from his past, and a balloon arch in his favorite colors — blue and white. It felt magical and personal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🎂 Cake & Food</h2>
        <p>Ordered a customized chocolate truffle cake that said "World's Best Dad." For food, I chose all his favorite homemade dishes and a few snacks from his favorite local restaurant.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🎁 Gifts & Surprises</h2>
        <p>We gifted him a smartwatch, a handwritten letter, and a video montage of everyone wishing him — friends, relatives, even his old colleagues. He teared up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>💖 The Celebration</h2>
        <p>When he entered the room, the lights turned on, and we all shouted "Happy Birthday Papa!" His shocked face, then teary eyes, and that warm hug — it was all worth it. We danced, sang, and shared laughter over memories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
        🎈 This was not just a party, it was my way of saying — Thank you, Papa, for everything. You are my hero. 🎈
